- Not too many slide
- Basic design (yellow or green will make it hard to see)
- Have a clicker
- Build the slide (appearing the word not use the sound)
- Include some photo

### Dealing with any problem

- Emergency: tea break
### Should and When give out note
- Before the talk
- Note with gap
- A finish note after talk (not let them know we will do that)
- Note act as a cue
### Ending Perfectly on Time
